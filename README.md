# WebAR-CovidTest-ARInfo

Hey! this is a project I made for an AR class I took in Thailand.
It leverages the myWebAR application to build a helpful program for scanning a common covid test in Thailand and displaying different images and 
information about the test and for covid in general.

check out my youtube video to see it in action https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mz4hQmjLh8p4PVaWG9cyg

below you can see the overview of the webAR setup and see the 3d model of the mask, with clickability to a link about the efficacy of different masks as well as 
different costs for ordering masks online.

on the left are the test instructions so its easier to see if the test is a nose swab or a spit and to just see the instructions.
the instructions also are clickable and bring you to the thai link on how to take the test (its so cute honestly check it out).
finally, I have some info on percentage accuracy from research of this test front and cneter so the customer is properly informed that a negative test result is NOT
always 100% accurate
